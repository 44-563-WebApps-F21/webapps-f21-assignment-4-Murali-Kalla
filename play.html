        <p class="speech duchess"> So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
            Mr. Hopper is very late, too. You have kept those five dances for him,
            Agatha? </p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Comes down_.]</p>
        <h6 class="name">LADY AGATHA.</h6>
        <p class="speech agatha">Yes, mamma.</p>
        <h6 class="name ">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Sitting on sofa_.]</p>
        <p class="speech duchess">Just let me see your card.
            I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
            safeguard. You dear simple little thing! </p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Scratches out two names_.]</p>
        <p class="speech duchess">No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons! It
            looks so fast! The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
            Mr. Hopper.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]

        <h6 class="name ">LADY AGATHA.</h6>
        <p class="speech agatha">Yes, mamma.</p>
        <h6 class="name">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Fanning herself_.]</p>
        <p class="speech agatha">The air is so pleasant there.

        <h6 class="name ">DUMBY.</h6>
        <p class="speech dumby">Good evening, Lady Stutfield. I suppose this will be the last
            ball of the season?</p>
        <h6 class="name ">LADY STUTFIELD.</h6>
        <p class="speech stutfield">I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It’s been a delightful season,
            hasn’t it?</p>
        <h6 class="name ">DUMBY.</h6>
        <p class="speech dumby">Quite delightful! Good evening, Duchess. I suppose this will be
            the last ball of the season?</p>
        <h6 class="name ">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h6>
        <p class="speech duchess">I suppose so, Mr. Dumby. It has been a very dull
            season, hasn’t it?</p>
