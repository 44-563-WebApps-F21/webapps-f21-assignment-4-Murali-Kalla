    <h2>Lady Windermeres Fan</h2> 
    <h4>_Drawing-room in Lord Windermere’s house_.  _Door R.U. opening into
        ball-room_, _where band is playing_.  _Door L. through which guests are
        entering_.  _Door L.U. opens on to illuminated terrace_.  _Palms_,
        _flowers_, _and brilliant lights_.  _Room crowded with guests_.  _Lady
        Windermere is receiving them_.
    </h4> 
    DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Up C._]  So strange Lord Windermere isn’t here.
    Mr. Hopper is very late, too.  You have kept those five dances for him,
    Agatha?  [_Comes down_.]

    LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.

    DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Sitting on sofa_.]  Just let me see your card.
    I’m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.—They’re a mother’s only
    safeguard.  You dear simple little thing!  [_Scratches out two names_.]
    No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons!  It
    looks so fast!  The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with
    Mr. Hopper.

    [_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]

    LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.

    DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Fanning herself_.]  The air is so pleasant there.

    PARKER.  Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.  Lady Stutfield.  Sir James Royston.  Mr.
    Guy Berkeley.

    [_These people enter as announced_.]

    DUMBY.  Good evening, Lady Stutfield.  I suppose this will be the last
    ball of the season?

    LADY STUTFIELD.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It’s been a delightful season,
    hasn’t it?

    DUMBY.  Quite delightful!  Good evening, Duchess.  I suppose this will be
    the last ball of the season?

    DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It has been a very dull
    season, hasn’t it?
